    <h1> Albert Einstein</h1>

    <img src="image 6.png"align="left"width="250">
    <h2>
      ALBERT EINSTEIN(14 March 1879 -18 April 1955) was
      a German-born scientist.[4] He worked on theoretical
      physics.[5] He developed the theory of relativity.[3][6] 
      He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for the
      oretical physics. His famous equation is 
E
=
m
c
2
{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}} (E = energy, m = mass, c = spe
      ed of light).

At the beginning of his career, Einstein did not think 
      that Newtonian mechanics was enough to reconcile 
      (bring together) the laws of classical mechanics and 
      the laws of the electromagnetic field. Between 1902-1909
      he developed the theory of special relativity to correct 
      tha
      t. E
      instein also thought that Isaac Newton's idea of
      gravity was not completely correct. So, he extended his
      ideas on special relativity to include gravity. In 1916 
      he published a paper on general relativity with his 
      theory of gravitation.

In 1933, Einstein was visiting the United States. In Ger
      
      many, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power. 
      
      Einstein, being of Jewish ethnicity, did not retu
      rn to Germany due to Hitler’s anti-Semitic polici
      es.[7] He lived in the United States and became an
      American citizen in 1940.[8] On the beginning of Wo
      rld War II, he sent a letter to President Franklin D. 
      Roosevelt explaining to him that Germany was in the 
      process of making a nuclear weapon; so Einstein 
      recommended that the US should also make one. This 
      led to the Manhattan Project, and the US became the 
      first nation in history to create and use the atomic 
      bomb (not on Germany though but Japan). Einstein and 
      other physicists like Richard Feynman who worked on 
      the Manhattan project later regretted that the bomb 
      was used on Japan.[9]

Einstein lived in Princeton and was one of the first 
      
      members invited to the Institute for Advanced Stud
      y, where he worked for the remainder of his life.
      He is widely considered one of the greatest scientists 
      
      of all time. His contributions helped lay the foundations
      for all modern branches of physics, including quantum mechanics 
      and relativity.

    <h2>
       Thomas Alva Edison(February 11, 1847 -October 18
      , 1931) was an American inventor and businessman 
      who has been described as America's greatest inven
      tor.[1][2][3] He developed many devices in fields 
      such as electric power generation, mass communicat
      ion, sound recording, and motion pictures.[4] Thes
      e inventions, which include the phonograph, the mo
      tion picture camera, and early versions of the el
      ectric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on
      the modern industrialized world.[5] He was one o
      f the first inventors to apply the principles of
      organized science and teamwork to the process of i
      nvention, working with many researchers and emplo
      yees. He established the first industrial researc
      h laboratory.[6]

Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in hi
      
      s career he worked as a telegraph operator,
      which inspired some of his earliest inventi
      ons.[4] In 1876, he established his first lab
      oratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, wh
      ere many of his early inventions were devel
      oped. He later established a botanic labora
      tory in Fort Myers, Florida in collaborat
      ion with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S
      . Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orang
      e, New Jersey that featured the world's fir
      st film studio, the Black Maria. He was a pr
      olific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in hi
      s name, as well as patents in other countries
      . Edison married twice and fathered six chil
      dren. He died in 1931 of complications of dia
      betes.

      Stephen William Hawking

    <img src="image 4.png"align="left"width="250">
    <h2>
      Stephen Willian Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA 
      (8 January 1942 - 14 March 2018) was an Engli
      sh theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and 
      author who was director of research at the Ce
      ntre for Theoretical Cosmology at the Univ
      ersity of Cambridge at the time of his dea
      th.[18][19][8] He was the Lucasian Professo
      r of Mathematics at the University of Cambrid
      ge between 1979 and 2009.

Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of doc
      tors. Hawking began his university educati
      on at University College, Oxford in October 1959
      at the age of 17, where he received a first-class
      BA (Hons.) degree in physics. He began his graduat
      e work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in October 
      1962, where he obtained his PhD degree in applied 
      mathematics and theoretical physics, specialisi
      ng in general relativity and cosmology in March 
      1966. During this period-in 1963-Hawking was di
      agnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing fo
      rm of motor neurone disease (also known as amyot
      rophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's di
      sease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades
      .[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he was able t
      o communicate through a speech-generating device—ini
      tially through use of a handheld switch, and eventu
      ally by using a single cheek muscle.

Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration 
      
      with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity 
      theorems in the framework of general relativity 
      and the theoretical prediction that black holes e
      mit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially,
      Haw
      king radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s a
      nd following the publication of further research, th
      e discovery was widely accepted as a significant brea
      kthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to 
      set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the
      gener
      al theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vi
      gorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
      mechanics.[22][23]

Hawking achieved commercial success with several wor
      ks of popular science in which he discussed his 
      theories and cosmology in general. His book A Br
      ief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Time
      s bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks
      . Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetim
      e member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a
      recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
      highest civilian award in the United States. In 200
      2, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of 
      the 100 Greatest Britons. He died on 14 March 2018 
      at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone di
      sease for more than 50 years.

    <h1>
      Sir Isaac Newton
    </h1>
       <img src="image 3.png"align="right"width="250">
    <h2>
      Sir Isaac Newton  PRS (25 December 1642 -20 
      March 1726/27[a]) was an English mathematician, 
      physicist, astronomer, theologian
      , and author (described in his own day as a "
      natural philosopher") who is widely recognised
      as one of the most influential scientists of al
      l time and as a key figure in the scientific r
      evolution. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Prin
      cipia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of 
      Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, 
      laid the foundations of classical mechanics. N
      ewton also made seminal contributions to opti
      cs, and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Le
      ibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

In Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion an
      d universal gravitation that formed the dominan
      t scientific viewpoint until it was superseded b
      y the theory of relativity. Newton used his math
      ematical description of gravity to prove Kepler's 
      laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the 
      trajectories of comets, the precession of the equ
      inoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about
      the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated th
      at the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies
      could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's in
      ference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was late
      r confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Co
      ndamine, and others, convincing most European scientists o
      f the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.


Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope
      and developed a sophisticated theory of colour ba
      sed on the observation that a prism separates w
      hite light into the colours of the visible spectru
      m. His work on light was collected in his highly i
      nfluential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also
      formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the firs
      t theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and
      introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addi
      tion to his work on calculus, as a mathematician N
      ewton contributed to the study of power series, 
      generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer 
      exponents, developed a method for approximating t
      he roots of a function, and classified most of 
      the cubic plane curves.

Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second 
      Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the Universi
      ty of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox
      Christian who privately rejected the doctrine 
      of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the 
      Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to t
      ake holy orders in the Church of England. Beyo
      nd his work on the mathematical sciences, Newto
      n dedicated much of his time to the study of 
      alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of
      his work in those areas remained unpublished un
      til long after his death. Politically and pers
      onally tied to the Whig party, Newton served tw
      o brief terms as Member of Parliament for the U
      niversity of Cambridge, in 1689-90 and 1701-02. He
      was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the l
      ast three decades of his life in London, servin
      g as Warden (1696-1700) and Master (1700-1727) 
      of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the 
      Royal Society (1703-1727).
