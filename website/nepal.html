      Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,[20] is a sove
      reign country in South Asia. It is mainly in the Himalayas, but also includ
      es parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is the 49th largest country by popul
      ation and 93rd largest country by area. It is landlocked, and borders China 
      in the north and India in the south, east and west, while Bangladesh is locat
      ed within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip and Bhutan is separated f
      rom it by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including
      fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallesta

 mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the cap

ital and the largest city. Nepal is a multiethnic country with Nepali as the official l

anguage.

      
The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subc

ontinent, the era in ancient India when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion 

of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BCE, Gautama Buddha, the founde

r of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were int

ertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwi

ned with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confeder

acy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated

 by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and

 architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal

. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with

 the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never col

onized but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parl

iamentary democracy was introduced in 1951, but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs,

 in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in the

 establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu monarchy.

The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms Nepal as a secular federal pa

rliamentary republic divided into seven provinces. It remains the only multi-party,

 fully democratic nation in the world ruled by a communist party. Nepal was admitted 

to the United Nations in 1955, and friendship treaties were signed with India in

 1950 and the People's Republic of China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent secret

ariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which

 it is a founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and

 the Bay of Bengal Initiative. The military of Nepal is the fifth largest in Sout

h Asia; it is notable for its Gurkha history, particularly during the world wars,

 and has been a significant contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations.
