    <h2>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectio
      us disease caused by severe acute respiratory sy
      ndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[9] It was 
      first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hu
      bei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pand
      emic. On 5 October, the WHO said that one in te
      n people around the world (around 800 million) m
      ay have been infected with COVIDâ€“19.[10] As of 7
      October 2020, 35.8 million cases have been rep
     orted across 188 countries and territories with
      more than 1.05 million deaths; more than 24.9 
      million people have recovered.[8]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shor
      tness of breath or breathing difficulties, an
      d loss of smell and taste.[6] While most p
      eople have mild symptoms, some people devel
      op acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS
)
      possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[11]

 multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.

 The incubation period may range from one to fou

rteen days.[12]

The disease spreads most often when people are phys
      ically close.[a] It spreads very easily an
      d sustainably through the air, primarily via
      small droplets and sometimes in aerosols, a
      s an infected person breathes, coughs, snee
      zes, talks, or sings.[14][15] It may also 
      be transmitted via contaminated surfaces,
      
      
      although this has not been conclusively dem
      onstrated.[15][16][17] It can spread for up t
      o two days prior to symptom onset and from 
      people who are asymptomatic.[15] People rem
      ain infectious for seven to twelve days in 
      moderate cases and up to two weeks in sever
      e cases.[15][12] The standard method of diag a
      nosis is by real-time reverse transcription po
      lymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a naso
      pharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be
      helpful for diagnosis in individuals where th
      ere is a high suspicion of infection based on 
      symptoms and risk factors, however guidelines do
      not recommend using it for routine screening.
      
Recommended measures to prevent infection include fr
      equent hand washing, social distancing, quarantine,
      covering coughs and sneezes, and keeping unwashed h
      ands away from the face.[7] The use of face masks o
      r cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandan
      a has been recommended by health officials in public
      settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with 
      some authorities requiring their use in certain setti
      ngs, such as on public transport and in shops. Health
      officials also stated that medical-grade face masks,
      such as N95 masks, should be used only by healthcare
      workers, first responders, and those who directly c
      are for infected individuals.

There are no proven vaccines or specific treatments for
      COVID-19 yet, though several are in development. M
      anagement involves the treatment of symptoms, supp
      ortive care, isolation, and experimental measures
      . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
      COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of Inte
      rnational Concern (PHEIC)[18][19] on 30 January 202
      0 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[20] Local transmi
      ssion of the disease has occurred in most countries 
      across all six WHO regions.[21]

      
      
Longer-term damage to organs (in particular lungs an
      d heart) has been observed, and there is concern 
      about a significant number of patients who have re
      covered from the acute phase of the disease but co
      ntinue to experience a range of effects including s
      evere fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issu
      
      
      es, low grade fever, muscle weakness, breathlessne
      ss and other symptoms for months afterwards.[22][23]
